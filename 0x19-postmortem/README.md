Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:

Duration: Start Time: January 20, 2024, 14:00 UTC | End Time: January 21, 2024, 02:30 UTC
Impact: Affecting our flagship e-commerce website, the outage resulted in a 35% user base unable to access the platform, with the remaining 65% experiencing significant slowdowns and intermittent errors during the incident.
Timeline:

Detection Time: January 20, 2024, 14:15 UTC
Detection Method: Automated monitoring alerted the operations team to an abnormal spike in error rates and latency.
Actions Taken:
Investigated backend services for potential issues.
Assumed initial root cause to be a database bottleneck.
Scaled up database resources to handle increased load.
Misleading Paths:
Focused initially on the database layer without analyzing frontend components.
Assumed increased traffic as a potential DDoS attack.
Escalation:
Escalated to the DevOps team for collaboration on backend investigation.
Involvement of the Security team to analyze potential security threats.
Resolution:
Identified the root cause as a misconfigured Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Temporarily redirected traffic away from the CDN to restore service.
Adjusted CDN settings to optimize for our specific workload.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the CDN caching rules led to the serving of outdated content, resulting in increased error rates and latency.
Resolution: Temporarily bypassed the CDN to serve content directly from origin servers. Adjusted CDN settings to enforce proper caching rules, preventing the reoccurrence of the issue.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement additional automated checks for CDN configuration inconsistencies.
Enhance monitoring to provide early alerts on CDN-related issues.
Conduct regular audits of CDN settings to ensure alignment with application requirements.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Automate CDN Configuration Checks:
Develop scripts to regularly validate CDN configuration against application requirements.
Implement automated alerts for any inconsistencies detected.
Enhance Monitoring:
Integrate CDN-specific monitoring metrics into the existing monitoring system.
Set up proactive alerts for deviations from normal CDN behavior.
Regular CDN Audits:
Establish a recurring schedule for manual audits of CDN settings.
Document and maintain a checklist for CDN configuration best practices.
Conclusion:
This outage emphasized the importance of comprehensive monitoring and thorough investigation across all layers of the web stack. The misconfiguration in the CDN, initially overlooked, showcased the need for a holistic approach to troubleshooting. Moving forward, the implementation of automated checks, enhanced monitoring, and regular audits will fortify our web infrastructure, ensuring a more resilient and responsive user experience.
